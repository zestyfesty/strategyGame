strategy is how each player effectively uses their acions points to prepare and get more stuff
progression should not means that earlier items are useless

items to protect the base
or you can choose to go out
choice to camp but not getting more resrouces
locator to get information on the enemy's items
how the environment effects the enemy encounter
various options for fighting
base shoudls also have interest, more you store mpre it'll increase

fast-get materials fast without waiting for ap interest (attack), waiters-wait until high interest build slow
game elements should enhance and set off each other/synergize effects of different item combine (many uses)



turn based:
game design:
    tile blocks:
        everytile block object has different values which will determine how game functions react to it
        eg. water blocks take more walking action points 

game feature:
    teleporter is the thing that returns you to base, appearing in the centre of the map, when charged then both
    players are returned to their base
    everything round the recharge time increases and map size decreases
    both players has base which they must protect
    stored items can be looted from other player's base
    
    max load x encumbered, max amount you can bring to each round, infinite store capacity for base

    food has delayed effect

    different environment different materials and dangers

    actions points regeneration ::::

    max inventory 5 or less 

    range of vision: clear 1st range, maybies 2nd range
    -before round there is a radar which you might be able to point to a certain location on map to see materials
    or it may be a hostiles radar 
    thus have to bring the nessisary stuff to get materials and suit for the environment



an element should be linked to many other elements creating a large range of different uses
Ideally, every single thing that’'s inside the game should be in direct support of the core mechanism
Every single element has to serve a particular purpose and have “its place” in the overall game. 
Instead of offering many game elements with few uses, offer the player few elements with many uses
proper resourse allocation  

start:
attacker - weapon-knife - discount for attacking moves
harvester - larger range of harvest
fatty - more health less movement - 

attacker>havester>fatty>attacker

all the starting characters must have meaknessess and strategies to overcome those other character

    foresight into the enemies terriory, small section
    
death:
simple hit
anything
traps



movement:
action pionts:
use more other person hit more


game over:
soemthing to protect is destroyed
ending death match

environment:
    mountains - dig into hiding, dig through tunnel, mountain range blocking sight and path
    river - moat, fishing with spear, fast tide does damage, hide in water for 1 round 
    packs or enemy ai groups 

    day night cycle :
        night - time enemy sleeping lower visibility around but lit bases easily seen, can't gain point
        day 
        

items: 
    wood, chest, walls
    sticks, build traps, make tools, wall, rope; +rocks - campfire, 
    rocks/pebbles, make tools, wall
    dirt, hide thing to protect, throughing it distraction, wall

    tools:
        shovel, get dirt, make hole, tunneling 
        pixaxe, getting through mountain
        axe, make spike trap from wood, 


    weapons:
        spear, hit rocks to see through rock
        knife, get meat from animals 
        bow, bow with rope hooks onto pray

crafting:
    in rounds, more materials, take more action points 
    between rounds, takes time, regual materials


base:
    you can deploy protection stuff around your base but it would take large amounts of time and maybe resources
    you can put buildings to reside in temporaly outside of your base - good decoy
    

strategies:
    deactivate the teleporter
    bait the other to use a bunch of stuff to kill you when you have nothing

    attacks and defend strats against such attacks 

    ability to build specialized buildings-workshop, walls, tower, 
    rethink different strategies when starting new round with nothing.

    turn off the teleporter without the other person knowing 
    better to craft things in round or between 

    make strategies based on what radar senses, make this or not, do this or not
